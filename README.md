# eportfolio
This is the official eportfolio collab project repo

Download/clone without the node_modules folder (if you have node installed)
and simply open cmd in the folder you clone it to and type npm i

Else clone with node_modules

also
added portfolio folder to gitignore as the portfolios take up too much space + privacy
(use git to pull, then commit changes and push to your own repo using git cmd make pull request when you need me to look at it)
